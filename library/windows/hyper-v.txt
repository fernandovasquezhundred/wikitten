Hi Ben,
That's odd. Based on my test, this feature won't be enable automatically after restart the computer.
Please double check your operation:
1. Press Windows key + X
2. Click Programs and Features
3. Click Turn Windows features on or off
4. Expand Hyper-V, uncheck it.
5. Click OK, restart if prompted.
